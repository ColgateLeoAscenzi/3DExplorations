1. The Phong model of lighting allows for more of the light to be relected off the surface making it look like there is a shiny circle where the light is opposite the shape. The lambert model produces more of a flat light.

2. The most satisfying thing to learn was how easy it is to put in models and control their movement and the lighting. After having spent 20 or more hours developing my own 3d-like 2d lighting system. I appreciate being able just to do: scene.add(light);

3. The biggest challenge was figuring out which png and css files were necessary.

4. I'm looking forward to using this extremely. I can't wait to begin implementing the game with my group. I'm hoping that the game will be popular and good looking enough to be played widely at Colgate, and maybe even by a small community elsewhere.

5. I think that reading graphics code is becoming like a second language to me. I've been able to help many classmates identify bugs within seconds of reading their code because I think I understand the flow completely of how x,y and z goes into making a picture display. It's also become easier to visualize and guess where certain coordinates are and what they will look like without even rendering it. Most importantly, however, I've started programming and compiling  incrementally so that I can get a good idea of how my image is changing relative to what I'm writing in the code. This is something I would before seldom do.
